| `.exrc`       | basic initialization file for the original ex/vi, in case vim isn't installed.  It has to be symlinked to `~/.exrc` |
| `.vimrc`      | main initialization file.  It has to be symlinked to `~/.vimrc`
| `.vimrc.post` | contains personal commands invoked after `.vimrc`.  You can create this file with your own customizations here.     |
| `setup.sh`    | sets up the files to be ready for vim.                                                                              |

# Installation

Requires:

* curl
* gpg [just for my private .vimrc.post.gpg]

```
[ -d ~/.vim ] && mv ~/.vim ~/.vim-OLD
git clone https://github.com/huyz/dot-vim.git .vim
cd ~/.vim
./setup.sh
```

# Mapping Quick Reference

## General tips

These are useful commands that are easy to forget because they're needed only
occasionally.

*   `cgn` + `.`         :   Incrementally change matches
*   `q:`  `q/`  `q?`    :   Open comand-line window (`^F` if already in command-line)
*   ``\`.``             :   Jump to last modification
*   `gv`                :   Reselect last visual selection
*   `ga`                :   ASCII/Unicode value of current character
*   `gP` then `.`â€¦      :   Paste successively
*   `viw` `cis` `dap` `yab` `ci'` `cit` `dat` ``ci` ``
    : Operations on word, inner sentence, paragraph, () block, quoted strings,
      html tags
*   `/<C-R><C-W>`       :   Pull current word into search
*   `/<C-R>"`           :   Pull in last yank
*   `[I`                :   Show lines that match current word
*   ```[ `` or `` `]``  :   Go to beginning/end of last change
*   `<C-X><C-L>`        :   Line complete, then hit `<C-n>` and `<C-p>`
*   `<C-X><C-K>`        :   Starts dictionary completion, then hit `<C-n>` and `<C-p>`
*   `==`                :   Reindent line(s)
*   `:ce`               :   Center line(s)
*   `!!date`            :   Replace current line with date (different from my `\-d`)
*   `:-1r`              :   Read in file above current line
*   `:reg`              :   List registers
*   `:argdo %s/f//`     :   Operate over all files listed on command line
*   `:windo %s/f//`     :   Operate over all viewable split windows
*   `:bufdo normal :%s,^,^R%,^M` : perform an operation on all buffers when
                      a register needs to be accessed (note that ^R ^M are
                      typed by hitting control-v and then control-r or -m)
*   `:bufdo exe "normal :%s,^,\<C-R>%,\<CR>"` : same as above
*   `:verbose set history?` : Find where an option is set
*   `:w !sudo tee %`    :   Save the current file with sudo privileges
*   `:perldo s/p/r/`    :   Do perl-compatible regex substitution

## My own mappings

I tend to forgot I defined these mappings:

*   `<C-s>`          : Save buffer
*   `<A-H>` `<A-J>`  : switch between split windows (note capitalization so there's no conflict with vim-visual-multi)
*   `<C-w><C-q>`     : Closes buffer without messing up split window
*   `gb`             : Re-select last pasted block
*   `\lh`            : Swap words
*   `Q` `gq` `<M-q>` : In visual mode, format by `par`, vim, or emacs-style
*   `\t0`            : Discard consecutive blank lines
*   `<Meta>q`        : Reformat paragraph (like emacs)

## Plugins I installed

*   `:GundoToggle`

### CtrlP

*   `<C-P>`     : switch buffer
*   `<C-P><C-B>` : find file
*   `<C-P><C-F>` : find MRU file
*   `F10`       : switch buffer

### fzf

*   `F11`       : find file
