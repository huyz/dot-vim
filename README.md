| `.exrc`       | basic initialization file for the original ex/vi, in case vim isn't installed.  It has to be symlinked to `~/.exrc` |
| `.vimrc`      | main initialization file.  It has to be symlinked to `~/.vimrc`
| `.vimrc.post` | contains personal commands invoked after `.vimrc`.  You can create this file with your own customizations here.     |
| `setup.sh`    | sets up the files to be ready for vim.                                                                              |

## My own mappings

| `Q` `gq` `<M-q>`      | In visual mode, format by `par`, vim |
